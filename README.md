# Activity-Monitor
Group project by:
Dinesh Sai Pappuru and Ruohe Zhou

Analysing the sensor data and predict the activity based on the sensor data

The project uses multiple machine learning models such as KNN, Logistic regression, SVM and LSTM to check which model performs more accurately

# Model interface

We used Gradio as an interfacce and use the LSTM model to predict the activity based on the sensor data
