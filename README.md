# Activity-Monitor
Group project by:
Dinesh Sai Pappuru and Ruohe Zhou

Analysing the sensor data and predict the activity based on the sensor data.

The project uses multiple machine learning models such as KNN, Logistic regression, Random forest classifier and LSTM to check which model performs more accurately.

# Model interface

We used Gradio as an interfacce and use the LSTM model to predict the activity based on the sensor data.

There should be atleast 100 rows with 12 columns in the csv file to test the model.
